          <h4>Facts about ADHD</h4>
          <ul class="li-style">
            <li>Research on ADHD explained that it´s based on hereditary factors (genetic factors) and the brain's regulation of the neurotransmitter’s dopamine and norepinephrine
              <ul>
                <li>Which regulates the reward system and the degree of alertness</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
              
              <li>In research it has also shown a decrease in activity in the frontal lobe of the brain, in people
              with ADHD
              <ul>
                <li>This part of brain is responsible to control a range of social, emotional, and cognitive (thinking) functions, as well as motor function and memory</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>That part of the brain is also that who primarily controls functions such as impulse control, activity level and
              attention.
            <ul>
              <li>These functions, called executive functions.</li>

        <h3>What is it like to live with ADHD?</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>My own story</h4>
        <p>I got ADHD - combined form. And that was why I decided to give attention to ADHD in this page. 
          Because ever since I was little, I have struggled with myself and people’s opinions about my actions.
          
          And I think if the knowledge about ADHD in girls had been more noticed that I had been diagnosed earlier in my life. This is the sad part because girls and women are living undiagnosed longer than boys/men, because often are girls learned to just fit in and don´t be so “much”. As my old principal told me “You are the clown in the class”. 
          
          Yes, you read it right, and it still hurts. Because if this grownup had paying attention, they maybe had noticed that it was not my purpose.
          That I for example just couldn’t sit still, focus, concentrate and get done with my things, in the same way as my classmates. Maybe I had not been questioning my self with this type of questions: 
          
          Why can´t I just sit still? 
          Why is it so difficult for me to get through stuff? 
          Why can´t I just wait on my turn? 
          Why am I reacting so strong in my feelings? 
          How could everyone understand, but I don´t, before I got information in another explanation? 
          
          This was just parts of all the questions. But when I got 19 years old, I finally got my questions answered, I had ADHD! And no, that’s not some kind of excuse of behavior, but it´s a good explanation of WHY things had and have happened.
