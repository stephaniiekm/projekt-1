# ADHD Website

## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

Website presents a small information about ADHD.
Users will be able to find interesting content in easy and simple way.

This project is for educational purposes and can not be used as a template for a business use.
Main is to build user friendly and responsive website with HTML and CSS only. I will use Bootstrap framework to keep website consent.
